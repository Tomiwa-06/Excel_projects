## 📊 Excel Project Workflow (Data Analysis)

This section outlines the complete process I followed to complete a data analysis project using **Microsoft Excel**. Excel remains a fundamental tool for data analysts because of its flexibility, accessibility, and powerful analytical features.

---

### 📁 1. Data Import & Cleaning

- Imported data from various sources including:
  - Excel files (.xlsx)
  - CSV/Text files
  - System exports
- Cleaned the dataset using:
  - **Remove Duplicates**, **Text to Columns**
  - Functions like `TRIM()`, `CLEAN()`, `PROPER()`
  - Dealing with blanks and errors using `IFERROR()` and `ISBLANK()`
  - Formatting columns (dates, numbers, currency)
  
> 🧼 **Goal:** Ensure a clean, structured, and reliable dataset

---

### 🧰 2. Data Transformation (Power Query + Excel Functions)

Utilized **Power Query** and native Excel functions to transform and reshape the data:

- In **Power Query**:
  - Renamed and reordered columns
  - Filtered unnecessary rows
  - Merged and appended tables
  - Performed unpivot and data type conversions
- In standard Excel:
  - Used formulas like:
    - `IF()`, `VLOOKUP()` / `XLOOKUP()`, `INDEX-MATCH`
    - `TEXT()`, `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, `MID()`
    - `DATE()`, `MONTH()`, `YEAR()`, `NETWORKDAYS()`

> ⚒️ Combined automation (Power Query) with dynamic logic (formulas)

---

### 📐 3. Data Modeling with Tables & Named Ranges

- Converted datasets into structured **Excel Tables** for cleaner references
- Defined **Named Ranges** to manage inputs and outputs more efficiently
- Built relational logic between sheets (e.g., lookup tables)

> ✅ Tables enabled dynamic range management and cleaner, scalable formulas

---

### 📊 4. Dashboard Creation & Visualization

Created a fully interactive and professional dashboard using:

- **Pivot Tables** to summarize key metrics
- **Pivot Charts** to visualize trends
- **Slicers** and **Timeline Filters** for user interactivity
- **Conditional Formatting** to highlight insights
- Custom KPI Cards showing metrics like growth %, targets, and rankings

> 🎯 **Goal:** Build a dynamic dashboard for stakeholders to explore insights visually

---

### 🧮 5. Scenario Analysis & Modeling

- Implemented **What-If Analysis**:
  - Data Tables (for sensitivity analysis)
  - Scenario Manager (for predefined case changes)
  - Goal Seek (to hit target outcomes)
- Used **Data Validation Drop-downs** for user inputs
- Applied **Solver Add-in** to optimize based on constraints (where applicable)

> 🔍 Built models to simulate business decisions and forecast outcomes

---

### 🔐 6. File Protection & Sharing

- Locked cells and protected worksheets to avoid accidental changes
- Used password protection where appropriate
- Shared:
  - Excel dashboards (editable or read-only)
  - Exported PDF reports
  - Zipped project files for easy download

---
